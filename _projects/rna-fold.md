The code base [here](https://github.com/harrisonlabollita/Kinetic-RNA) and [here](https://github.com/harrisonlabollita/RNA-Fold) is a collection of code that I worked on to design and test different folding algorithms for predicting how an RNA sequence would fold. 

A schematic of the Gillespie type algorithm that I implemented to predict how a given RNA sequence would fold.

I worked on this research project as a Researh Rotation Student in Fall 2019 in the Sulc group at Arizona State.
