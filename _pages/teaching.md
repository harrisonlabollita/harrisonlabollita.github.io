*An electron's point of view: How the quantum world influences materials.*

How de we know that copper is a good conductor and plastic is a good insulator? How do scientists know how to manipulate the mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties of a material? In this club, we will explore the quantum world of electrons and discover how the unique properties of their world give rise to technologically useful phenomena such as superconductivity. We will learn the basic concepts of quantum theory and how they apply to materials, while also identifying they key "knobs" that can be turned to control their properties. We will introduce the computational techniques that are used by scientists all over the world to understand, engineer, and design new materials with specific properties for technological applications. With this new knowledge, we will perform our own calculations for real materials and identify the key features in the results that give scientists insight into a material's properties. Our calculations will be performed using an open-source program written Julia. Please note that no prior programming experience is required, learning the basic syntax of Julia is part of the club! This course intends to pique the interest of students in this fields of condensed matter, material science, and computational physics.
