I use and develop computational tools to study strongly correlated materials. Specifically, I study the correlated electronic structure of rare-earth nickelates using ab-initio methods. For more info, checkout some my recent publications.

#### Reserach Interests üë®‚Äçüî¨
- Modeling strongly correlated electron materials using DFT+DMFT
- Quantum impurity solvers applied to DMFT.
- Data-driven/machine learnign techniques for discovery of novel materials.
- Quantum computing algorithms for electronic structure methods.
