I'm a graduate student at [Arizona State University](https://abotana.physics.asu.edu/people) studying computational condensed matter physics. I'm currently interested in using and developing computational tools to study real strongly correlated materials.


Research interests
------------------

I'm a computational condensed matter physicist (in training ü§ì) interested in studying strongly correlated electron systems. Currently, I'm studying the electronic structure of the rare-earth nickelates using density-functional theory (DFT) as a starting place and employing more sophisticated many-body techniques to uncover ther underlying physics. Broadly, I'm interested in using in developing compuational tools to study strongly correlated materials at large. The main two compuational frameworks, I use are density-functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Check out my recent [publications](https://harrisonlabollita.github.io/publications/) to read more about what I've been up to!
