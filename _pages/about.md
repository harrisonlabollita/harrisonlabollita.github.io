By day, I'm a graduate student at [Arizona State University](https://abotana.physics.asu.edu/people) working in the [Botana Group](https://abotana.physics.asu.edu). Broadly, I'm interested in using and developing computational tools to study strongly correlated materials. Specifically, I study the correlated electronic structure of rare-earth nickelates using a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). [Here](https://harrisonlabollita.github.io/publications/) are some of recent publications. 

By night, I'm a wanna be [Python developer](https://github.com/harrisonlabollita), machine learning enthusiast, and [freelance tutor](https://is.gd/exAOqr)! During my freetime, I like to be outstide running, playing tennis, or on the golf course.

**Let's get in touch!**
I'd love to chat or get a ‚òïÔ∏è if you're in Tempe
